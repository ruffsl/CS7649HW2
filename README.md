#This code requires:

##Python
* [python 2.7](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
  * `sudo apt-get install python`
* [ipython](http://ipython.org/install.html)
  * `sudo apt-get install ipython`
* [ipython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
  * `sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook`
* [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/)
  * `sudo apt-get install python-scipy`

## Matlab
* [R2014b](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)

# How to
* View the notebook
 * You can view the notebook by simply using nbviewer render the .ipynb file in your browser
 * http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/RIP2014/HW2_Team3/blob/master/Code/HW2.ipynb
* Run the notebook
  * You open and run the notebook by launching a ipython kernel in the same directory as the HW3.ipynb
  * `$ cd Code/`
  * `$ ipython notebook`
  * your browser should launch a new tab. Click on the HW2.ipynb notebook to start it
  * step through the cell execution by hitting 'shift' + 'enter'
  * For more instruction on ipython see the [introduction guide](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/notebook/notebook.html#introduction)
  * This notebook provides the step by step instructions to reproduce our results shown
  * **Note**: Some path specific variable specified in the notebook should be altered to reflect the present working directory of the ipython notebook file and the Code folder.
