How to run the code:

Problems 1 and 2 use Matlab and the instructions to run the code are below.  The code for problems 3-5 can be run directly within the ipython notebook.

Problem 1
In the diretory Code/Q1/ for Bug 1, just run bug1.m and for Bug2 bug2.m.  The domains are encoded in domain1.m and domain2.m 


Problem 2
Run each section of Problem2.m individually. The first section finds the solution to Part a, the second section find the solution to Part b, and the Extra section runs the field with 30 random obstacles.  Since Part b throws an error, to see Extra run, just run the section by itself

Problem 3
Just run rip_hw2.m.  Change qNumber (l.12) = 1 for part a, 2 for part b. For part b, change avoid_collision (l.13) = 1 to avoid thw collision against the obstacle.  If 0, collisions will occur.

Problems 4 and 5 just run the ipython notebook.
